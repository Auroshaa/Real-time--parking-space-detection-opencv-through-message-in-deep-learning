# REAL TIME PARKING SPACE DETECTION OPENCV THROUGH MESSAGE IN DEEP LEANING 

## üìåOverview
Rapid urbanization and increasing vehicle ownership have made finding parking in congested areas challenging. This project presents a real-time parking space detection system using computer vision and deep learning to help drivers locate available spots efficiently.

## üîë Features
- **Real-Time Detection:** Uses camera sensors to capture live video feeds of parking areas.
- **Computer Vision & Deep Learning:** Implements OpenCV with CNNs and YOLO models to detect and localize vehicles accurately.
- **Messaging Integration:** Drivers can request parking availability via SMS, WhatsApp, or Telegram. The system responds with the number and location of available spots.
- **Smart Urban Mobility:** Provides a seamless, real-time solution to enhance parking experiences and contribute to smarter cities.

## ‚öôÔ∏èTechnologies Used
- Python, OpenCV  
- Deep Learning: CNN, YOLO  
- Messaging Platforms: SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram  

## üöÄ Benefits
- Reduces time spent searching for parking  
- Improves urban mobility  
- Offers instant, up-to-date parking information  
 
## Methodology

 - CCTV capture the parking spot available in the Organization space in the real time bases and using that it stores the number plate of each car in the database and number of space available. Using the localhost at port number 5000 the Api runs and The core program used for the project is python, after the available space will be sent as a message to the organization‚Äôs employee.
